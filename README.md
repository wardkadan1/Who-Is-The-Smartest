# Who-s-The-Smartest

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Who’s The Smartest  
**Team Leader:** Orr Atalai

1. **Objective**
   "Who’s The Smartest" is an interactive, high-stakes trivia game that challenges players on Jewish and Arab traditions, history, and customs. Players answer 10 questions, starting with 3 lives. Each incorrect answer costs a life, and losing all lives ends the game. Successfully answering all 10 questions without losing all lives earns the player the grand prize of being crowned "The Smartest."

2. **User Objective**
   As a player, I want to engage in an exciting trivia experience to test my knowledge of Jewish and Arab traditions, history, and customs, enjoying the thrill of competition while learning new cultural and historical facts.

3. **Main Technologies**

- **HTML:** Structure the web pages
- **CSS:** Styling and layout
- **JavaScript:** Handle dynamic features, user interactions, and event handling
- **MockAPI:** Store question data in JSON format (e.g., a question format example):
  ```json
  {
    "question": "Which city is considered holy by both Jewish and Muslim people?",
    "answers": ["Mecca", "Jerusalem", "Cairo", "Tel Aviv"],
    "rightAnswer": "Jerusalem",
    "hint": "This city contains the Western Wall and Al-Aqsa Mosque."
  }
  ```
